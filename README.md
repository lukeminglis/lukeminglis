- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Luke Inglis!
- ğŸ‘€ Aside from the drive to code, Iâ€™m a big sports fan, love playing videogames, and I workout somewhat often.
- ğŸ¤“ Iâ€™m currently studying Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science at Texas A&M University.
- ğŸŒ± I love utilizing Python to spend an hour automating a five minute task, or C++ if I want to do the same thing in three hours!
